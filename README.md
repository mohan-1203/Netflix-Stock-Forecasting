# Netflix-Stock-Forecasting
### Conducted full time-series analysis on Netflix’s 2018–2022 daily stock prices—starting with EDA, boxplots, and trend/seasonal decomposition.
### Performed stationarity diagnostics (ADF, KPSS) and achieved stationarity via differencing, guided by ACF/PACF analysis.
### Implemented and benchmarked baseline models (naive, moving average, Holt‑Winters) to quantify baseline performance.
### Built classical models (ARIMA/SARIMA) with hyperparameter tuning using AIC/BIC and auto_arima, and extended to SARIMAX/VARX with exogenous inputs like trading volume.
### Developed a hybrid ARIMA‑LSTM model, using ARIMA to model linear trends and LSTM on residuals to capture non-linear patterns—yielding improved accuracy (lower RMSE/MAPE) over standalone ARIMA
