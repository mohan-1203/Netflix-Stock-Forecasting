# Netflix-Stock-Forecasting
### Performed end-to-end time series analysis on Netflix stock using Python, incorporating exploratory data analysis (EDA), box plots, and seasonalâ€‘trend decomposition (STL).
### Assessed and enforced stationarity by applying ADF and KPSS tests, executing differencing techniques, and interpreting ACF/PACF plots.
### Benchmarked baseline models (Naive, Moving Average, Holt-Winters) to establish reference performance metrics. Built and tuned ARIMA/SARIMA models using AIC/BIC and Auto-ARIMA; extended to SARIMAX/VARX by integrating exogenous variables (e.g., trading volume).
### Improved a hybrid ARIMA-LSTM model to combine linear (ARIMA) and non-linear (LSTM) forecasting, improving prediction accuracy with reduced RMSE and MAPE.
